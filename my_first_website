All of the files here are of the same 1 website.
This website was made only as a project for the course web development.
In this website we basically sell electronical products.
It's a responsive website with a unique design.
Since this was my very first website, at that time i didn't know about user friendly colours and user friendly interfaces.
Thus it might not be that good. but still i put alot of effort in it.
I later started practicing more on web development to increase my knowledge and understanding of the language.
